# About HYMET
HYMET (Hybrid Metagenomic Tool) is a pipeline designed for taxonomic identification and analysis of metagenomic sequences. It combined $k$-mer screening with smart alignment system that dynamically switches between high-precision and efficient tools depending on the genomic characteristics of the sample, followed by taxonomic assignment using exact matches and weighted lowest common ancestor strategies. 

HYMET can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/inesbmartins02/HYMET2/releases).
